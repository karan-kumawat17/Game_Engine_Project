### Game_Engine_Project:

#### Building a game engine from scratch in C++..

     C++ Programming:
        You should have a solid understanding of C++ since most game engines are written in this language.
        Source: Start with online C++ tutorials and courses on platforms like Codecademy, Coursera, or Udemy. Books like "Accelerated C++" by Andrew Koenig and Barbara E. Moo can also be helpful.

    Computer Graphics:
        Learn the principles of computer graphics, including rendering pipelines, shaders, and 3D mathematics.
        Source: "Computer Graphics: Principles and Practice" by James D. Foley, Andries van Dam, et al., is a classic book in this field. Online resources like OpenGL and DirectX tutorials can be valuable.

    Mathematics for Game Development:
        Develop a strong foundation in linear algebra, geometry, and calculus as they are essential for understanding graphics and physics in game engines.
        Source: Khan Academy offers free math courses. For more advanced topics, "Essential Mathematics for Games and Interactive Applications" by James M. Van Verth and Lars M. Bishop is a great resource.

    Computer Science and Algorithms:
        Learn data structures and algorithms as they are crucial for efficient game engine design.
        Source: "Introduction to Algorithms" by Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, and Clifford Stein is a widely recommended book. You can also explore online courses on algorithms on platforms like edX and Coursera.

    OpenGL or Vulkan (Graphics APIs):
        Choose a graphics API for rendering. OpenGL and Vulkan are popular choices.
        Source: The official documentation and various tutorials and books are available for both OpenGL and Vulkan.

    Physics Simulation:
        Understand physics principles and implement a physics engine for collision detection and rigid body dynamics.
        Source: Books like "Real-Time Collision Detection" by Christer Ericson and online resources on physics engines can be helpful.

    Input Handling:
        Learn how to handle user input from devices like keyboards, mice, and controllers.
        Source: Online tutorials and documentation for libraries like SDL and GLFW.

    Audio Programming:
        If your engine will support audio, learn about audio programming and libraries like OpenAL.
        Source: "Game Audio Programming" by James Boer is a useful book for this topic.

    Resource Management:
        Develop a system for loading and managing game assets like textures, models, and sound files.
        Source: Online resources and documentation for resource management in C++.

    Debugging and Profiling:
        Learn debugging techniques and profiling tools for identifying and fixing issues in your engine.
        Source: Online debugging tutorials, and tools like GDB for debugging and tools like VTune for profiling.

    Scripting Languages:
        If you want to allow users to script game logic, learn a scripting language like Lua or Python.
        Source: Official documentation and tutorials for the scripting language of your choice.

    Version Control:
        Learn to use version control systems like Git to manage your codebase.
        Source: Online tutorials and documentation for Git.

    Game Design Principles:
        Familiarize yourself with game design principles to create a user-friendly engine.
        Source: Books on game design like "The Art of Game Design" by Jesse Schell can provide insights.
